# cs50-recover
This program recovers JPEGs from a forensic image using "signatures," patterns of bytes that distinguish JPEGs from other file formats. It accepts one command-line argument, the name of a forensic image from which to recover JPEGs.

Assigned as PSET 4 during Harvard's fall 2018 CS50 course.
